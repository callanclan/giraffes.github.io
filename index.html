<title> Giraffe Ears</title>
<h1> Ears </h1>

<h2> Welcome to Giraffe Ears</h2>

<p>
Giraffes are the tallest terrestrial animals and have a unique and enigmatic appearance. They have a body design that is very different from any others out there. Due to how tall they are it is hard to believe that they can weigh so much. A full grown male giraffe can weigh up to 2,600 pounds while females are quite a bit smaller about 1,800 pounds.

Evidently, the first thing that grabs our attention is the great height they have which oscillates between 15 and 20 feet, being the males higher than females.

Giraffes vary in dimensions according to the gender and the species, but even the smallest are huge for us. As the males have larger dimensions than the females, there is sexual dimorphism in this animal.
<br>
The body of the giraffe is relatively little compared to the magnitude of other body parts, but its bone structure supports the substantial weight of its organs and its long neck, which allow it to achieve fast speeds when running.

The weight of the females ranges from 1,200 to 2,500 pounds, but the average is 1,800 lbs. In males, this is higher, because their average weight is 2,600 pounds, and the range goes from 1,800 to almost 4,400 pounds.

Their tail is thin and measures from 32 to 40 inches in length.

<br>
The strange protuberances that giraffes have on the head similar to horns are called “ossicones” to differentiate them from the antlers of other animals since they are different from these. They are two knobs of an ossified cartilage of approximately 5 inches and covered with fur. These structures are a way of distinguishing genders since those of the females are thinner and with a more hair than those of the males which are thicker and with very little or no fur.

The researchers think that the primary function of these ossicones is related to body thermoregulation, but they are also effective for battles between males.

Some develop a lump on the forehead that has the appearance of a third ossicone, and one species looks like having five of them. It is common for male individuals to grow calcium deposits on the head as they get old which give them this appearance.
 <br>
The coat design of giraffes is one of their most striking features. According to the subspecies, the kind of pattern varies, but besides that, each giraffe has a unique and unrepeatable pattern of spots that get darker with age, but never change their design.

The skin of the giraffes has a characteristic smell that repels insects and parasites and the dark parts also function as a thermoregulation system. Brown, dark orange, light brown and beige are the primary colors in the coats of giraffes.

The head of a giraffe is small and quite long with a rounded mouth at the end of it. They feature little ears that look like those of a deer on the sides of their ossicones.

The face of giraffes has a friendly and peaceful look. They have big brown eyes with long lashes that protect them from the glare of the sun. Their tongue is prehensile, dark and measures between 18 and 20 inches long. It is used to hold their food and take it to their mouth, as well as to clean their nose. A series of papillae protect the lips, tongue, and interior of the mouth from the dangerous thorns of the plants and trees that giraffes eat, like the Acacia tree.
<br>
The extra long and prehensile tongue of the giraffe also helps them to clean bugs off their face as well as to reach very high for food sources in the trees.

The lips of the giraffe are very thick to help protect them during eating. Many of the twigs and trees that they eat have sharp elements that could harm them if they weren’t.

The long and powerful neck of giraffes is their most characteristic feature, measuring up to 6.5 feet in length and formed by seven cervical vertebrae as in other mammals, including the human being, but with the difference that each of vertebrae has a large size reaching up to 11 inches.
 
The seven individual vertebrates of the giraffe’s neck have particular joints which give them flexibility. The shoulders of these animals are also robust to hold up that large neck. The two are anchored together through a variety of muscles so that there isn’t strain on the shoulders.

The head and neck of the giraffe are attached to the body by a set of muscles and ligaments that join the long vertebrae, giving the animal a pronounced hump at the start of the neck.
